# ðŸš² BRUBIKE

In order to create and evaluate bicycle traffic flow models, bike traffic information from all cities around the world is required. External features such as weather data can be exploited to improve models or develop new models. For that purpose, BRUBIKE aims to make Brussels' historical bike count and weather data more accessible to other researchers.

## Data Description

As time passes, more historical data becomes available and new potential features can be added to the BRUBIKE dataset. The following table will provide an identifier for each of the existing datasets that can be used for the development and evaluation of traffic models. **/data** acts as the root directory for the published datasets.
